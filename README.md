# Notes App
### This is only for practice, not meant for production

I am building a notes app using Django to experiment with
different features and practice the framework.

Some key features so far:
- User authentication utilizing Django's built in methods
- User specific notes using Django models
- Embedded text editor for styling notes
- Time stamps for latest updates to notes
- Styled and made responsive using Bootstrap
